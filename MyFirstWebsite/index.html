            <h3>Logic Gate</h3>

            <p> It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical
                operation
                on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>

            <h3>ASCII</h3>
            <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers,
                so it is
                the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
            <h3>RAM</h3>
            <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the
                general
                speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same
                amount of
                time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
            <h3>Programming languages</h3>
            <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of
                output. They
                generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement
                specific
                algorithms.</p>
            <h3>DNS</h3>
            <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
                Internet
                or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the
                participating
                entities.</p>
            <h3>HTTP</h3>
            <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the
                foundation
                of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer
